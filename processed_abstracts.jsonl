Foremost, although the authors are highly respected, the study was observational, and why some patients in each category received early NIT and others did not is unknown. Paradoxically, providers might be expected to recommend or perform early NIT on patients with higher risk, which might be associated with poorer outcomes. Therefore, the finding that early NIT was associated with better outcomes is surprising. Nonetheless, unobservable variables such as patient motivation might have accounted for the differences. Highly motivated and concerned patients are likely to be less ill; to modify behaviors that would otherwise place them at risk; and, of course, to seek early NIT. In addition, patients with multiple possible chest pain etiologies (eg, acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, or pneumonia) are probably less likely to receive early NIT than patients for whom coronary artery disease is the only real concern. Such patients might inherently be more ill (at risk of MI, pulmonary embolism, or cancer) than the comparators, thus potentially explaining the observed differences. The authors correctly suggest that trial data are necessary to support reversion to the 'stress everyone early' practice. Finally, this study occurred in an environment without highsensitivity troponin testing- a major issue, given the marked changes in definitions of low or moderate risk since 2017. Whether these findings might be replicated now is unclear.", 'entities': []}

In a simple example, for respiratory tract infections, if a chest x-ray had been performed and indicated pneumonia, the child would have been diagnosed with pneumonia and not included in this cohort. In addition, the measure of head CT for seizure is problematic, because the Choosing Wisely campaign specifically states that a head CT for new seizure is OK, but the data did not indicate whether children were scanned for a first-time seizure vs a known seizure disorder.

Although the AI system (RBFracture) showed strong standalone performance (92% sensitivity, 83% specificity, and 87% accuracy), the actual clinical benefit for inexperienced physicians was modest and increased the diagnostic accuracy by only 2.6%. This limited improvement prompts important questions about cost-effectiveness in real-world emergency departments, where resources are often constrained. The finding that the AI occasionally led physicians to incorrectly change their initially correct diagnoses (1.5% of cases) also highlights the importance of maintaining clinical judgment alongside technological assistance in fast-paced emergency settings.", 'entities': []}

The main benefit, which we have mentioned, is that NMAs enable simultaneous comparison of multiple treatments, even when direct head-to-head trials are lacking. Another key advantage is their enhanced statistical power and precision: by synthesizing evidence from a broader set of studies, NMAs often provide more reliable effect estimates and narrower confidence intervals than individual studies or pairwise meta-analyses. Consequently, treatment differences that might not be evident in smaller direct comparisons may be detected. NMAs also help rank treatments by efficacy and safety, thus providing clinicians and policymakers with clear, actionable insights. Instead of simply concluding whether 1 treatment is superior to another, NMAs generate rankings that can guide treatment choices according to each intervention's probability of being the most effective or safest option  .

The potential decrease in chemical sedation (35% vs 18%) is interesting (although not statistically significant), because it might translate to fewer medication-related adverse events, shorter ED stays, and improved resource utilization. Future research should examine the cost-effectiveness of implementing therapy-dog programs, as well as their effects on specific high-risk populations, such as children with developmental or psychiatric disorders.

Moreover, unlike S100B, these biomarkers are not affected by skin pigmentation and therefore are more universally applicable across diverse patient populations. However, several limitations warrant consideration: given the heterogeneity in sampling times, varying cutoff values across studies, and poor specificity, using these biomarkers indiscriminately might increase the number of unnecessary head CT scans, and the use of different analytical techniques would complicate standardization for clinical implementation.", 'entities': []}

Across 16 included studies, the combination of GFAP and UCH-L1 had a sensitivity of 100% and an NPV of 100% for ruling out intracranial injury among adult patients with head trauma. Unfortunately, firm recommendations for use cannot be made, largely because of heterogeneity among studies. We also need to keep in mind that using these biomarkers indiscriminately might paradoxically increase the number of unnecessary head CT scans, because of their poor specificity of approximately 30%. Although these biomarkers represent a promising advance for emergency medicine, additional prospective implementation studies are needed to confirm the real-world effects on decreasing CT scans and to establish standardized protocols before widespread adoption in emergency departments.', 'entities': []}
