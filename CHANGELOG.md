## Development Notes

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Weaviate vs. Other Vector DBs**: Chosen for Docker support and schema flexibility
2. **spaCy SciSciBERT**: Medical domain-specific NLP for better query understanding
3. **Gradio Interface**: Rapid prototyping with professional appearance
4. **Dual LLM Support**: Flexibility between local privacy and cloud capability

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Multiple medical domains (radiology, pathology, etc.)
- [ ] Advanced query analysis and intent detection
- [ ] Model fine-tuning on medical literature
- [ ] Multi-language support
- [ ] Integration with medical databases (PubMed, etc.)
- [ ] Advanced citation and reference management
- [ ] User authentication and session management
- [ ] API endpoints for programmatic access

### Known Limitations
- Requires significant GPU memory for optimal performance
- Medical literature limited to emergency medicine abstracts
- LM Studio requires manual model management
- Single-user interface (no multi-tenancy)
